# LearningASM
My goal here is to keep track of Assembly Projects ive made. Since im learning this on my own with some assistance from a book, if anyone actually sees this, things may not run using normal conventions. As far as im concerned, this is a fun little experiment. Before this all i know is some Python and Javascript. I attempted C++ a few years ago, nothing really happened, was too confused. So i thought "Oh boy, if C++ is confusing, i may as well go one layer deeper" unfortuantely that was C, and for whatever reason I dont feel the need to learn C, so instead of going one lower... ASM. I think I need help

I am learning this assembly on Linux Mint, it will be x64 ASM. If you understood that then good for you

My goal is to make a MMORPG in ASM. My first step is to figure out how multiplication works
